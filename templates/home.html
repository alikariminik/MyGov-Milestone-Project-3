            <h4>Welcome</h4>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting MyGovernment! If you are like me and are trying
                to keep up to date with what feels like a rotating door of a government, then you are in the
                right place. Since 2016, there have been 5 different Prime Minister's and each one
                of them have overseen complete shuffles of their cabinet: resignations, re-appointments and sackings of
                dozens of Cabinet Ministers whilst in office.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is why I have decided to create MyGovernment - an easy way to keep my dedicated database
                of the current United Kingdom's Government up-to-date. This allows me to keep track
                of all the comings and goings at Number 10.
            </p>

                With all the changes over the last few months, we are looking for more people

                all the data is kept. Specifcally, by being a registered user of MyGovernment, you will

                there records for good if they were to stop being a Cabinet Minister.
